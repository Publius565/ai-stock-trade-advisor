# AI-Driven Stock Trade Advisor - Development Chat History

This document records development conversations, decisions, and important discussions related to the AI-Driven Stock Trade Advisor project.

## 2025-07-26 11:40:00 - Project Initialization

**User**: Read this document and the rules and create project documents.

**Apollo**: I'll read through the document and create the required project documentation following the user rules. Let me start by examining the current workspace structure and then create the necessary documentation files.

**Actions Taken**:
- Examined current workspace structure
- Created `/docs/` directory
- Created `manifest.md` with complete project structure listing
- Created `devreadme.txt` with technical specifications and dependencies
- Created `TODOS.md` with comprehensive task tracking system
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` with version history and change tracking
- Created `chathistory.md` for ongoing conversation recording

**Key Decisions Made**:
1. **Documentation Structure**: Following user rules 4.0-4.5, created all required documentation files in `/docs/` folder
2. **Project Organization**: Planned modular architecture with separate directories for different components
3. **Technology Stack**: Selected Python-based stack with PyQt6 for GUI, SQLite for database, and comprehensive ML libraries
4. **Development Phases**: Organized tasks into 10 phases from setup to advanced features
5. **Version Control**: Established semantic versioning with planned release schedule

**Rules Triggered**:
- Rule 4.0-4.5: Created all required documentation files
- Rule 2.1: Prepared for Git repository maintenance
- Rule 3.1: Broke down large project into manageable phases
- Rule 5.4: Identified as Apollo, matter-of-fact developer
- Rule 5.5: Used plain language for accessibility

**Current Status**: 
- Project documentation framework complete
- Ready to proceed with Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation
- All required documentation files created and populated

**Next Steps Proposed**:
1. Initialize Git repository for version control
2. Create project directory structure as outlined in manifest
3. Set up Python virtual environment
4. Install core dependencies
5. Begin Phase 1 implementation

**Working Directory**: `C:\Users\blake\Cursor Development\Agent Green`

## Development Notes

### Project Scope
The AI-Driven Stock Trade Advisor is a comprehensive Windows-based application that combines rule-based logic with machine learning to provide personalized stock trading recommendations. The application operates locally for user privacy and connects to public financial APIs for real-time market data.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Local-First Design**: All data stored locally, no cloud transmission for privacy
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate components for data ingestion, user profiles, trading engine, execution, and UI
- **Hybrid AI Approach**: Combination of rule-based expert system and machine learning models
- **Dual-Tier Recommendations**: High-risk/high-reward and low-risk/low-reward suggestions
- **Paper Trading Integration**: Simulation mode for strategy testing

### Technology Choices
- **Primary Language**: Python 3.9+ for rich financial ecosystem
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt6 for native desktop experience
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage and simplicity
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch
- **Data Processing**: pandas, NumPy, TA-Lib
- **APIs**: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, Alpaca Trading

### Compliance Considerations
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in risk disclosures and disclaimers
- **Security**: Encrypted API key storage and local data only
- **Privacy**: No cloud transmission of personal data
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of recommendations and decisions

### Development Approach
- **Incremental Development**: 10-phase approach from foundation to advanced features
- **Testing Integration**: Continuous testing throughout development
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation maintained throughout
- **User-Centric**: Focus on user preferences and risk tolerance
