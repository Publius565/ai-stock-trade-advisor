AI-Driven Stock Trade Advisor - Technical Documentation
=====================================================

APPLICATION OVERVIEW
-------------------
The AI-Driven Stock Trade Advisor is a Windows-based desktop application that provides personalized stock trading recommendations using a combination of rule-based logic and machine learning. The application operates locally for user privacy and connects to public financial APIs for real-time market data.

Core Features:
- Personalized risk profiling and trade suggestions
- Dual-tier recommendations (high-risk/high-reward and low-risk/low-reward)
- Real-time market data integration
- Paper trading simulation mode
- Performance analytics and tracking
- Machine learning-based adaptive strategies
- Local data storage and privacy protection
